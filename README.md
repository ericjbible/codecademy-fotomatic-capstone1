# Codecademy Capstone Project - Fotomatic

This is a capstone project in the Codecademy Pro skill path titled "Build a Website with HTML, CSS and Giithub Pages"

In this project I am tasked with fixing a broken version of a responsive website called Fotomatic.

There's a website specification that is housed [here] (https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-1/specs/fotomatic_spec_landing.png) which I must work to meet the requirements therein.

This project primarily uses HTML and CSS.
